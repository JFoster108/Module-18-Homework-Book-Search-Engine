# Module-18-Homework-Book-Search-Engine

## Description
This takes a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactors it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end. This is a homework assignment for the web development bootcamp sponsered by UNC Chapel Hill.


## Installation
